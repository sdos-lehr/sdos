# Example management implementation for SDOS
This project is a python implementation of the suggested SDOS API. 
It essentially is a webserver, which listens for data to be put in or data to be queried.

## Dependencies

This project uses `flask` for conveniently handling tcp requests and to serve some simple html pages.

Proxying (internal forwarding to other management nodes) is done using `urllib.request`.
